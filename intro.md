#Introduction
Welcome to AffinityNG, the "next generation" edition of Affinity (alpha2 release)!  

AffinityNG is licensed as open-source software under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  

AffinityNG is a universal embedded *platform* for information processing, control and communication,
with a graph database at its heart. [pathSQL](./terminology.md#pathsql) programs are stored as
[PINs](./terminology.md#pin) alongside plain data.  

###Where To Find Information
For an overview of AffinityNG, please have a look at this
[presentation](../promo/ddos.html).  Additional context is available in the [FAQ](./FAQ.md), list of [features](./features.md),
and assessment of Affinity's [strengths](./strengths.md).

<!-- TODO: ddos.html is actually not too bad but let's refresh it with Mark's latest prez contents -->

The page on [terminology](./terminology.md) can be used as introductory material,
to assimilate the terms and concepts in Affinity. In particular, it quickly describes
the [data model](./terminology.md#essentials-data-model), the [interfaces](./terminology.md#interfaces)
and the [software components](./terminology.md#software-components) in the Affinity package. This page also cements the rest of the 
documentation, which points to it as a unified reference. Finally, it contains
an alphabetically ordered [list of terms](./terminology.md#list-of-terms), for quick lookup.

The documentation contains introductory documents with a lot of code examples:  

1. [setup](./getting started.md)  
2. [pathSQL basics: control](./pathSQL basics [control].md) - <span class='pathsql_new'>NEW</span>  
3. [pathSQL basics: data](./pathSQL basics [data].md)  

It also contains reference material:  

1. [pathSQL reference](./pathSQL reference.md)  
2. [pathSQL communications](./pathSQL reference [definition].md#communication-pins) - <span class='pathsql_new'>NEW</span>  
3. [server](./server.md)  
4. [javascript interface for node.js](./interface [javascript].md)  
5. [protobuf interface](./interface [protobuf].md)  
6. [kernel (C++ interface)](./interface [cplusplus].md)  

You can also navigate using the table of contents in the combo on the upper-right corner of each page.  

Some pages point directly to examples in the source-code, e.g. [affinity.proto](./sources/affinity_proto.html).

Enjoy!
