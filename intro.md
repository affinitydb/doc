#Introduction
Welcome to Affinity!

Affinity is a new open-source database kernel,
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

For an overview of the philosophy behind Affinity, visit the [FAQ](./FAQ.md).
There's also a list of [features](./features.md), and an assessment of Affinity's
comparative [strengths](./strengths.md).

The page on [terminology](./terminology.md) can be used as introductory material,
to assimilate the terms and concepts in Affinity. In particular, it quickly describes
the [data model](./terminology.md#essential-concepts-data-model), the [interfaces](./terminology.md#interfaces)
and the [software components](./terminology.md#software-components) in the Affinity package. This page also cements the rest of the 
documentation, which points to it as a unified reference. Finally, it contains
an alphabetically ordered [list of terms](./terminology.md#list-of-terms-in-alphabetical-order), for quick lookup.

The documentation contains a few introductory sections:  

1. [setup](./getting started.md)  
2. [pathSQL primer](./pathSQL primer.md)  
3. [javascript interface for node.js](./javascript.md)  

It also contains references:  

1. [pathSQL reference](./pathSQL reference.md)  
2. [Affinity server](./Affinity server.md)  
3. [Affinity kernel's C++ interface](./cplusplus.md)  
4. [protobuf interface](./protobuf.md)  

Some pages point directly to examples in the source-code, e.g. [affinity.proto](./sources/affinity_proto.html).

Enjoy!
