#Strengths
As a whole, the set of [features](./features.md) proposed by mvStore aims at bringing together
the best from existing database technologies, including relational, object-oriented,
graph-oriented, document-based and RDF systems. The intent is to provide a unified and powerful
database solution that facilitates integration, and reduces the long-term impacts of choosing
any one specialized technology.

This page further describes the comparative strengths of mvStore.
Here's a table that emphasizes some of the capabilities that you can expect to find
in mvStore, in a nutshell:

##Entities evolving freely over time
In mvStore, each instance of an entity (aka _[PIN](./terminology.md#pin)_ or _object_ or _instance_) is free to contain any attribute
at any time. An entity is not bound to any table (or _type_ or _[class](./terminology.md#class)_ or _category_).
Instances evolve independently from the categories to which they may belong at any point in time.
This is accomplished without any compromise with respect to transactional integrity or performance:
PINs and their classification change in the context of transactions, and rely on indexes.
A transaction can involve any number of PINs.

##Discoverability, information re-use, and information sharing
While objects can evolve freely in mvStore, it remains possible to discover and track them
at any moment. mvStore provides several mechanisms: [classification](./terminology.md#class),
full-scan queries (not recommended for finished applications but convenient during development),
and [notifications](./terminology.md#notification).

The ability to query the store is essential for mutli-user collaboration and for inter-application 
interoperability. Objects created or modified by one agent can be discovered by other agents 
without explicit transmission of data between agents. The agents simply monitor 
(or wait for notifications from) the database which serves as a common intermediary similar 
to "publish and subscribe" messaging systems. 

Information re-use is the idea that the information in a persisted object should not be locked up by 
the application which created the object. If the information is valuable to its owner, the owner should be able to 
manipulate that information using a variety of applications (of the owners choice).

Information sharing is the idea that if information is represented with sufficient "semantics", then it can 
be shared and interpreted by other systems. Note that even a partial shared understanding of some of the properties 
in an object between systems is sufficient for this kind of interoperability.

##Self-descriptiveness
Objects in mvStore are naturally serializable as dictionaries that fully describe their full contents.
Therefore, it's trivial to export or transport objects.

##Data before structure (a two-step modeling process)
mvStore makes it possible for data to exist before structures are defined (or refined or modified).
This capability rests in part on the definition (by applications) of a globally meaningful,
consistent and stable vocabulary of [property names](./terminology.md#property).
The selection (or creation) of such a vocabulary represents 
the first step of data modeling with mvStore, and suffices to enable the creation of data. 
The second step is categorization, and it happens independently and dynamically.
mvStore recognizes that pre-defined structures and schema are essential for most computer programs.
This separation between pure (intrinsic) data structure and application-enabling schema is designed to
facilitate the coexistence of applications, and their sharing of data. mvStore also allows
to transform data at query time.

##Property names as URIs: avoiding confusion
By requiring a global vocabulary of [property names](./terminology.md#property), and emphasizing the importance of selecting
universal, high-quality definitions from the start (that will last throughout the life-cycle and
at every level of the modeling process), mvStore reduces the chances of confusion related to imprecise terminology.

##Agile categorization
The relational approach implies a water-fall modeling process: an a-priori, all-or-nothing exercise of categorization 
(one cannot insert rows in a table that is not yet defined). This often crystallizes into rigid 
physical models (tables, views, indexes), where objects can only be represented in one state of their
potentially evolving structure (for example, in real life a merchandise item may be moved or modified;
depending on where the merchandise is located, more or less attributes may be required to track it;
it's not possible in a relational database to just move that row across various tables).
Also, it is difficult to 'correct' pitfalls once the database contains data. Incomplete or extensible 
models (such as plug-in architectures) require awkward modeling strategies. Integration with external 
data sources can be painful. In contrast, mvStore proposes a much more agile approach, where 
[categories](./terminology.md#class) can be created and modified iteratively, without affecting the data. Categories and 
structures can be known to (or defined by) some software components (e.g. plug-ins), and ignored by others.

##Super-types as first-class citizens
With mvStore, the identity of objects is automatically secured (by their [PID](./terminology.md#pin-id-pid)),
and the type hierarchy is free to evolve independently from instances.
Super-types can pre-exist sub-types, and when sub-types are declared they don't modify, invalidate or
hide super-types, or force any manual reorganization of the data. Types can be specialized and combined.
Objects can match multiple types (aka [classes](./terminology.md#class) or categories). Use-cases
that imply a proliferation of sub-types are not an issue for mvStore. Software components are free to
interact with super-types or sub-types, at their convenience.

##No need to model attributes as entities
In the relational model, when it becomes too difficult to model complex problems
due to unstable or unpredictable structures, a last-resort solution involves a method sometimes
referred to as "very high level of attribute generalization", which consists in
modeling attributes as entities, such that arbitrary sets of attributes can be
combined to represent a wider variety of things. mvStore's [PIN](./terminology.md#pin) does that
implicitly.

##No need to create unnecessary structures
Not all structures require the same level of detail in modeling, or the same accessibility. For example,
applications that handle catalogs of components will be primarily interested in organizing common aspects of these
components, and would gladly leave out the minute details of each component (plug-ins can
take care of these details; or generic introspective methods can walk the complementary information).
The exercise of fitting all this component-specific data into a relational model
becomes a waste of time, justified mainly by the need for a unified storage infrastructure.
mvStore allows these structures to coexist (without the pain of rigid modeling), and to 
evolve into their ideal usage in due time (with the help of dynamic classification).

##Temporary data in-place, and implicitly indexed
Another consequence of mvStore's data model is that temporary data can be
attached directly to already existing [PINs](./terminology.md#pin). All pre-existing 
indexes on those PINs remain valid access paths to the temporary data, and come at no extra cost.
The same holds for references. Compared with temporary tables, this can
represent a significant performance advantage (in terms of indexing and
locking, for example). mvStore does not require any special (in-advance)
modeling or planning.

##Exclusivity arcs in-place
In relational modeling, exclusivity arcs model mutually exclusive relationships between
entities (e.g. an inventory item can only be at one place at one time). In the object-oriented
realm, this can be represented with a pointer to a base-class, and sub-classes. With mvStore,
another option is to implement this in-place, with a single [PIN](./terminology.md#pin)
that just evolves over time.

##Automatic assignment of globally-unique IDs to all instances
The relational model implies a complex decision process for each table: the selection of a primary key.
Object databases in general, and mvStore in particular simplify this process by attributing a globally unique surrogate 
key ([PID](./terminology.md#pin-id-pid)) to every object ([PIN](./terminology.md#pin)). 
This key enables random access to the instance, without the cost of an additional index. 
Combined with [references](./terminology.md#pin-reference), it simplifies 
the modeling of relationships, and the traversal of graphs. In the context of super-types and sub-types, 
the globally unique PID eliminates issues such as contention for the next (shared)
unique id across multiple tables, or partially-null primary keys. In the context of data warehousing,
the PID removes the problem of accounting for each new dimension table in the compound primary key of the
fact table. More generally, these characteristics reduce significantly the causes of debate around primary
(and surrogate) keys encountered in relational modeling.

##References and easy graph navigation
By avoiding joins for traversals on specific instances, mvStore provides similar advantages as object and graph databases,
in comparison with relational systems. mvStore also allows set operations on references, and [collections](./terminology.md#collection)
of [references](./terminology.md#pin-reference), providing the best of both worlds _(note: path indexing 
is not yet available, but planned for a future release; joins are used in the meantime)_.
References are simpler to model than foreign keys, and further reduce the burden in terms of selecting keys upfront
(and in an immutable way).

##Path expressions for compact set navigation
The following relational queries

  select * from emp e
  where e.deptno in(select d.deptno from dept d
  where e.deptno = d.deptno);

  select * from emp e
  where exists (select d.deptno from dept d
  where e.deptno = d.deptno);

Can be written in a more compact form with mvStore, in a model using [references](./terminology.md#pin-reference):

  select * from emp where exists(dept);

Similarly,

  select P.upc from Productlist as P
  where P.upc in
    ((select W.upc from Warehouse as W where W.upc = P.upc),
    (select T.upc from TruckCenter as T where T.upc = P.upc),
    (select G.upc from Garbage as G where G.upc = P.upc)) and P.makerid in
    (select M.id from Maker as M where M.country = 'Belgium');

becomes:

  select upc from Inventory where maker.country = 'Belgium';

##Ordered collections to retain sequential information
When normalizing a relational model, there is sometimes a risk of missing or losing
sequential information (such as the order of repeating column groups, that could
have implicitly represented the sequence according to which drugs should be administered, for example).
mvStore's [collections](./terminology.md#collection) allow to easily model this information, 
without falling back on weaker representations such as repeating column groups or sequence columns.

##More with less (entities)
In many cases, mvStore reduces the number of entities or columns required to model data.
For example, [references](./terminology.md#pin-reference) simplify the representation of many-to-many 
relationships. [Collections](./terminology.md#collection) can spare additional tables, 
repeating groups or sequence columns. [Units of measurement](./terminology.md#unit-of-measurement) 
save an extra column. URIs (and eventually enumerations) can spare a category table.

##Transactional, automatic full-text indexing
mvStore automatically indexes text properties, without any additional work required by the client
(no 'tsvector' or 'VIRTUAL TABLE' or 'FULLTEXT' index), while allowing to easily exclude undesired properties
and PINs. Values of collections are indexed as well. Indexing happens synchronously alongside all 
other transaction operations, and queries can combine text searching with other conditions, 
with the same ACID expectations as for any other index.

##Units of measurement
mvStore allows to easily attach semantic value to floating point values, using [units of measurement](./terminology.md#unit-of-measurement).
This simplifies modeling, enhances the semantic value of data, and enables automatic conversions in the evaluation of 
expressions involving those values.

##SQL-friendliness
Even though the mvStore [data model](./terminology.md#essential-concepts-data-model) is quite different from relational databases,
[mvSQL](./terminology.md#mvsql) is designed to be as close to SQL as possible (especially
the [DML](./mvSQL reference.md#keywords)).

##XML-friendliness
[Collections](./terminology.md#collection) and [references](./terminology.md#pin-reference) allow to easily represent 
the XML structure. [Namespaces](./terminology.md#namespace) and [property names](./terminology.md#property) (as URIs) 
further facilitate the mapping. It is possible to map the whole 
database to a single virtual XML document, in which XPath can navigate efficiently
and comprehensively. _Note: mvStore doesn't currently provide a XQuery or XPath interface, 
but may in the future._

##RDF-friendliness
The "subject-predicate-object" model can be easily represented in mvStore with the PIN as subject,
the property as predicate, and the value as object.

##No constraint on string length
mvStore is designed to deal with very flexible data structures, without sacrificing performance.
In particular, it does not require any upfront decision regarding the length of strings:
no CHAR vs VARCHAR vs LONG specification. Long strings can be explicitly stored on [separate pages](./terminology.md#ssv)
if desired, and very long strings can be accessed via a streaming interface.

##No compromise with structured data
Even though mvStore opens up the data modeling options and emphasizes
a freedom that could be associated with object-oriented, graph or document databases for example,
no compromise is made when the time comes to process structured data.
Great care is invested to represent data on [pages](./terminology.md#page) in the most compact form possible, and
to ensure data locality.

##Rich queries with joins
The query engine is extremely flexible, and accommodates
the SQL [DML](./mvSQL reference.md#keywords) without difficulty, with joins as first-class citizens.
Advanced features such as path expressions and path indexing push the envelope by making set operations on graphs
considerably more easy and efficient.

##No compromise with transactions
mvStore makes no compromise with transactions. For example, it integrates full-text
indexing and searching into the transaction boundaries, with the same ACID guaranties
as everything else. The default PIN locking protocol used is "strong 2-phase-locking"
(all locks that a top-level transaction has acquired are held until the transaction terminates).
Unlike document databases, which usually can't do multi-object transactions, mvStore takes no shortcut
with respect to transactions. This choice makes room for the coexistence of applications that
require full transactional support, along with applications that require weaker transactional
guaranties (such as those well suited for document databases).

##Transactional DDL
mvStore's model is not only less tightly coupled with schema, but its DDL (Data Definition Language)
is transactional. This contributes to a simpler database maintenance process, for example when applying
migration patches (no need to worry about half-applied migration patches).

##Snapshot isolation for high concurrency
[Snapshot isolation](./terminology.md#snapshot-isolation) enables non-blocking reads of
stable, consistent data. This isolation mechanism provides excellent ACID guaranties,
while enabling highly-concurrent read-intensive scenarios, without affecting normal
write activity. In the future, it may also be used as a foundation for backup,
replication etc.

##Nested transactions
mvStore conveniently allows code in a session to emit transactions inside already existing transactions.
This can be useful, for example, when integrating third-party software components.

##Robust recovery
Database recovery (the process that guaranties consistency when restarting the database after a crash) 
is one of those features that are practically invisible... until you need to count on it. 
It's difficult to implement properly, difficult to test, and difficult to prove for correctness in
practice (even though the algorithms are formally established). Fortunately, mvStore was used 
for several years in an embedded, multi-user context, and as
a result it had the opportunity of experiencing countless crashes, resulting in huge efforts
to make recovery rock-solid.

##Small, portable, embeddable
The [mvStore kernel](./terminology.md#mvstore) is a small library (<50K LOC, < 1Mb binary) written in C++
and ported to all mainstream platforms (windows, linux, OSX, ARM). It allows one to configure all essential
aspects of its runtime footprint (global memory usage, memory usage per session, disk usage, file sizes etc.).

##Uniform programming environment with notifications
The mvStore kernel does not accept stored procedures, and does not process triggers directly.
Instead, it forwards [notifications](./terminology.md#notification) (e.g. via [mvServer](./terminology.md#mvserver)) to clients
that request them, thus allowing those clients to express their data-change handling code in the
same programming environment as the rest of the application.

##Notifications to implement state machine or discrete-event dynamic systems
Class and PIN notifications cover the whole spectrum of value changes, structural changes
and state transitions that can occur over time. The notification approach further
facilitates the implementation of complex systems based on such events.

##No ideological battle with encapsulation and multiple-inheritance
With its use of object IDs ([PIDs](./terminology.md#pin-id-pid)) and
[references](./terminology.md#pin-reference), mvStore can be considered an object-oriented database.
Interacting with entities as objects is a deliberate choice. However, mvStore stays away from
intimate associations with any particular object-oriented programming language, by providing
a pure-data abstraction (the [PIN](./terminology.md#pin)) and expression evaluation
primitives. These pure-data primitives can be integrated to programming languages as appropriate.
With this choice, mvStore is less exposed to ideological debates around
schema and code migrations, encapsulation, and multiple-inheritance.
In that respect, mvStore adopts a stance similar to some of the recent
graph and document databases.

##Constraints transformed into qualifying criteria for classification
In general, constraints are conspicuously absent from mvStore's interfaces. This is because mvStore
is designed to bridge together various data storage approaches and representations of knowledge,
with special care to allow evolution of structures in time. As a result, mvStore functions
with an open-world assumption. In relational modeling, even simple attributes can actually
model constraints (e.g. only a woman can have a maiden name). With mvStore, constraints
become qualifying criteria for classification (if a class requires a maiden name, then
only objects with a maiden name will be classified by it; or conversely, if a class excludes
maiden names, then objects with a maiden name will not be classified by it).

##Flexible security features
mvStore offers AES encryption of pages and log files. It can also attach a HMAC signed cryptographic
checksum to each page, thus preventing attacks (in a context where encrypted pages may be stored
on external or cloud storage), and also providing redundant page-level integrity check.
Sessions are authenticated for owner and guest users. mvStore's interface also prevents
SQL injection attacks.
