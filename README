mvStore documentation

The documentation is written in markdown format.

It can be read in pure text. That experience is not ideal for beginners,
because the documentation is designed to accelerate learning,
by providing a lot of context via links.

The documentation can also be read in a rendered form, directly from the source
in github (just click on intro.md or any other file in this project).
Note that github only follows links to the destination document,
not to a specific section.

Finally, a html rendering is provided (to read in a browser).
This option should provide the best reading experience.
