#Getting Started with mvStore

##Setup
mvStore is hosted on github, from where it will be released as a series of
open-source projects. Github requires these preliminary steps:

1. create a personal (free) user account in github (visit https://github.com/)
2. setup a ssh keypair (uploading the public key to that github account)

mvStore is not yet open to the public. For now, it resides in private projects.
Until mvStore becomes open-source, the procedure to install from github
will involve the following steps (on linux):

3. send your account's user name to maxw@vmware.com, to become a private collaborator
4. git clone git@github.com:mvStore/setup.git
5. bash ./setup/linux/setup.sh

This will install the kernel, server, nodejs, doc and other components of the release,
and start the database server.

_Note: When mvStore becomes open-source, the procedure will be further simplified:
steps 3-5 will be replaced with a single step involving a publicly accessible setup script._  
_Note: Similar setup procedures for Windows and OSX are planned but not yet available._  
_Note: A higher-level flavor involving cloudfoundry is also planned._  

##Simple Access
The database [server](./terminology.md#mvserver) process is called `mvstored`
and listens to HTTP requests on port `4560` by default. For more details on how to run
and parametrize `mvstored`, please refer to the [server](./mvStore server.md) page,
or run `mvstored -h`.

The server exposes a javascript online console at the root (e.g. `http://localhost:4560/`), 
which allows to navigate the contents of the store and modify data. Just open that URL
in a browser. The console can also facilitate learning mvSQL.

##Quick mvSQL Guide
Please find a quick guide [here](./mvSQL getting started.md).

##Binary Components
For an overview of the software components involved, please read this [page](./terminology.md#software-components).
Here's a short table summarizing the parts involved.  

File                             Description
---------------------------      -----------
mvstore.dll / libmvstore.so      The [mvStore kernel library](./terminology.md#mvstore)
mvstored[.exe]                   The database server, also known as [mvserver](./terminology.md#mvserver)
server/src/www                   The server's online console
mvstore-client.js                The client library for [node.js](./mvStore js.md)
mvcommand[.exe]                  (optional) A [command-line app](./terminology.md#mvcommand) to interact with the db
mvclient.dll / libmvclient.so    (optional) The http client library that mvcommand uses to talk to the db
msvcp100.dll (windows only)      If not already present on your machine, it can be obtained [here](#links-to-msvcp100-dll)

##Runtime Files
For each distinct store created by `mvstored`, one file named `mv.store` will be created. This is the data file.
Additionally, any number of files following the pattern `mv*.txlog` may be created, containing transactional
logs for database logging & recovery. Upon a checkpoint or a clean shutdown, the `mv*.txlog` files are automatically deleted.

By default, `mvstored` puts those files in the parent folder of the docroot directory specified with the `-d` argument.
