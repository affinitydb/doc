#Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 17, 2013 

##General Information
GoPivotal respects the privacy of our customers and other visitors to our Web sites.
We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that you provide to us.
GoPivotal has therefore established this Privacy Statement to assist you to understand what personal information we collect
and how that personal information is used. This Privacy Statement applies to data collected by GoPivotal Inc. and 
GoPivotal Global (“GoPivotal”) through the affinitydb.org Web site and other Web pages which we operate and in which we post
a direct link to this Statement. 

##What personal information is collected on this site?
On this Web site when registering to view the site and access the demo, GoPivotal asks you to provide your email address.
As you navigate this Web site, GoPivotal may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools,
such as cookies and web beacons as referenced below.

##How does GoPivotal use this personal information?
GoPivotal will use this personal information to provide you with information and services and to help us better understand
your needs and interests. Specifically, we use your information to help you register to use the services, to communicate
with you and to provide ongoing service and support.  Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete 
surveys that we use for marketing and quality assurance programs. 

##With whom does GoPivotal share personal information?
GoPivotal may contract with third party service providers to deliver certain services. GoPivotal may share personal information
with its service providers to the extent needed to deliver the service or respond to requests for information on products
or services or otherwise support your business needs. Third party service providers and suppliers receiving personal
information are expected to apply the same level of privacy protection as contained in this Privacy Statement. They are
required to keep confidential the personal information received from GoPivotal and may not use it for any purpose other 
than as originally intended.

Except as described in this Privacy Statement, GoPivotal is not in the business of selling or renting your information to others 
and will not share personally identifiable information with other third parties without your permission, unless required by, 
or in connection with, law enforcement action, subpoena or other litigation, or applicable law or in connection with a 
prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business, or within the group of 
affiliated GoPivotal companies, if and to the extent legally permissible.

We reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form.

##Security of Personal Information

##Forums and Blogs
Some of GoPivotal's Web sites allow our users to publish content via discussion forums, blogs, user-editable documents,
and commenting systems. Any information that is disclosed in these forums becomes public information which could be read, 
collected or used by other users to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
information you choose to submit in these forums. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

GoPivotal may, from time to time, send email regarding our products and services to users who have posted to our discussion forums, blogs, 
user-editable documents, and commenting systems. Each participant's opinion expressed is his or her own and should not be considered 
as reflecting the opinion of GoPivotal. Note also that your use of these online communication tools is subject to our Terms of Use, 
which contain disclaimers, limitations of liability and a choice of California law.

##Cookies, Logging and Spotlight Tags
GoPivotal uses cookies on some of its web sites. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to your browser from a web server and
stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can help a website recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage
behavior. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. If a cookie is placed,
thereafter when you visit a web site, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the web site.
You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web browser. However, not utilizing cookies
may prevent you from using certain functions and features of web sites. The information we collect and analyze is used to
improve our service to you and personalize your web-browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your
interests and requirements regarding our website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie,
giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. 

Some GoPivotal pages use cookies that permit select third party partners, including Google, to serve you GoPivotal-related content,
including GoPivotal advertisements, on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to our site.
As noted above, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
You may also opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/.

As is true of most websites, GoPivotal collects and/or logs Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser
and operating system used to access the GoPivotal web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and
date of each visit. GoPivotal collects these through the use of log files and web beacons.

##Links to Non-GoPivotal Websites and Third Parties
This Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites for your convenience and information. If you access those links,
you will leave the affinitydb.org Web site. GoPivotal does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from
this Privacy Statement. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party Web sites.  We encourage you to review
the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. Some third party companies may choose to share
their personal data with GoPivotal; that sharing is governed by that third party company's privacy policy.

##Contact Information
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement or believe that the privacy of your personal information has not been respected,
