#Getting Started with Affinity

##Setup
Affinity is hosted on github, from where it will be released as a series of
open-source projects. Github requires these preliminary steps:

1. create a personal (free) user account in github (visit https://github.com/)
2. setup a ssh keypair (uploading the public key to that github account)

Affinity is not yet open to the public. For now, it resides in private projects.
Until Affinity becomes open-source, the procedure to install from github
will involve the following steps (on linux):

3. send your account's user name to maxw@vmware.com, to become a private collaborator
4. git clone git@github.com:Affinity/setup.git
5. bash ./setup/linux/setup.sh

This will install the kernel, server, nodejs, doc and other components of the release,
and start the database server.

<p style="color:red">
_Note: When Affinity becomes open-source, the procedure will be further simplified:
steps 3-5 will be replaced with a single step involving a publicly accessible setup script._  
_Note: A similar setup procedure for Windows is planned but not yet available._  
</p>

##Simple Access
The database [server](./terminology.md#server) process is called `affinityd`
and listens to HTTP requests on port `4560` by default. For more details on how to run
and parametrize `affinityd`, please refer to the [server](./Affinity server.md) page,
or run `affinityd -h`.

The server exposes a javascript online console at the root (e.g. `http://localhost:4560/`), 
which allows to navigate the contents of the store and modify data (same as what you find
[online](http://Affinity.cloudfoundry.com)). Just open that URL
in a browser. The console can also facilitate learning pathSQL.

##Quick pathSQL Guide
Please find a quick guide [here](./pathSQL primer.md).

##Binary Components
For an overview of the software components involved, please read this [page](./terminology.md#software-components).
Here's a short table summarizing the parts involved.  

File                             Description
---------------------------      -----------
affinity.dll / libaffinity.so    The [Affinity kernel library](./terminology.md#affinity)
affinityd[.exe]                  The database [server](./terminology.md#server)
server/src/www                   The server's online console
affinity-client.js               The client library for [node.js](./javascript.md)
afycommand[.exe]                 (optional) A command-line app to interact with the db
afyclient.dll / libafyclient.so  (optional) The http client library that afycommand uses to talk to the db
msvcp100.dll (windows only)      If not already present on your machine, it can be obtained [here](#links-to-msvcp100-dll)

##Runtime Files
For each distinct store created by `affinityd`, one file named `affinity.db` will be created. This is the data file.
Additionally, any number of files following the pattern `affinity*.txlog` may be created, containing transactional
logs for database logging & recovery. Upon a checkpoint or a clean shutdown, the `affinity*.txlog` files are automatically deleted.

By default, `affinityd` puts those files in the parent folder of the docroot directory specified with the `-d` argument.
